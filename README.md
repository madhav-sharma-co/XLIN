# Xlin-soft

**A calm, clean desktop for Hyprland on Arch Linux.**
Light and dark themes, glass panels, smooth animations, and a complete set of its own apps.

## Highlights

- **One install, everything set up.** The installer and every update bring the system and all packages Xlin-soft needs up to date (`pacman -Syu`) and install the missing ones, hook Xlin-soft into your Hyprland config and apply the theme. New dependencies arrive by themselves. To install only what is missing, run with `XLIN_NO_UPGRADE=1`.
- **Its own apps.** Settings, Files, Terminal, Store, Media, System Monitor, Notes, Clock, Calendar, Calculator, Screenshot, Welcome and a debug tool, all in one look.
- **Light and dark, everywhere.** One switch (Super+D) restyles every Xlin-soft app, every menu, the bars, the lock screen and other GTK apps, at once.
- **Smooth.** Gentle window, menu and workspace animations (Off, Subtle or Smooth in Settings). Settings, Files, Store and the Launcher wait out of sight, so they open instantly.
- **Flexible.** Change the system font or text size and every window, panel and widget grows to fit.
- **Works with current Hyprland.** Hyprland 0.55+ with the Lua config (the only format from 0.57) and older versions with `hyprland.conf` are both supported.

## Install

    git clone https://github.com/madhav-sharma-co/XLIN.git
    cd Xlin-soft
    ./install.sh          # asks for your password to install packages
    hyprctl reload        # or log out and back in
    xlin doctor           # shows anything missing

Run it as your normal user, not root. The installer backs up the Waybar, swaync and Hyprland
files it changes and installs whatever is missing (from the Arch repositories, and the AUR when
you have `paru` or `yay`).

**Update:** open **Settings → About → Update Xlin-soft**, or run `xlin update`. By hand:

    cd Xlin-soft && git pull && ./update.sh

**Update packages and repair missing ones at any time:** `xlin deps`

**Remove Xlin-soft** (your old Waybar, swaync and Kitty configs are put back): `xlin uninstall`

## Requirements

Arch Linux (or an Arch-based distribution) with Hyprland. The installer takes care of everything
else: Waybar, swaync, hyprlock, hypridle, gtk4-layer-shell, vte4, NetworkManager, BlueZ, PipeWire,
grim, slurp, cliphist and the rest of the list in [`scripts/deps.sh`](scripts/deps.sh).
The Run Bar uses `nwg-dock-hyprland` (AUR; installed for you when `paru` or `yay` is present).

## Hyprland versions

- **0.55 and newer** read the Lua config. The installer adds `pcall(require, "xlin")` as the last
  line of `~/.config/hypr/hyprland.lua` (backup kept) and creates the file if it is missing.
  Hyprland 0.57 no longer reads `hyprland.conf`.
- **Older versions** keep using `hyprland.conf` with a `source` line for `xlin.conf`.

Shortcuts not working? Run `xlin hook`, then `hyprctl reload`.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Try |
|---------|-----|
| Something is missing | `xlin doctor`, then `xlin deps` |
| Shortcuts do nothing | `xlin hook` and `hyprctl reload`, then `xlin keys check` |
| An app looks old after an update | `xlin restart` (waiting apps are replaced) |
| Slow first open of an app | Keep apps ready is on by default: `xlin warm on` |
| Anything else | SysDebug (`xlin debug`) shows checks and logs. Logs are in `~/.cache/xlin/` |

## Project layout

    bin/         the xlin command and the Xlin-soft apps (GTK4, Python)
    lib/         code shared by the apps
    config/      Hyprland (Lua and conf), Waybar, swaync, Kitty, shell and app launchers
    templates/   theme files with colour placeholders, filled in by `xlin theme`
    themes/      the light and dark palettes
    scripts/     dependency installer, icon, wallpaper and cursor generators
    assets/      cursors, icons, wallpapers
    install.sh   first install      update.sh   update without reinstalling
